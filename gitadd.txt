What are the git status and git add commands?

Git status shows the status of the current repository you are in. It shows if any files are untracked by git or not.

Git add prepares the files you are about to commit to a repository by placing them in a staging area so that you don't have to commit every single untracked file at a time although it is possible to commit one file at a time. This staging area contains all the files that you are about to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

staging area shows which files have been modified before you commit and, if multiple files have been modified and added to the staging area, it will show which files have been modified when we check it with the git status command
